# Compilers

Create either local install or dockerized setups of some fun
programming language compilers.

In a strike of inconsistency, you can either build the dockerized
version from the base of the repo by entering `make nim` (for the
Nim target only, for now), or you can install a local setup on your
account by entering the `Nim` directory and typing `make install`.

Typing `make` by itself will display a usage message along with
any useful information it can quickly glean (upstream release
version, local installed version).

Please enjoy responsibly!
